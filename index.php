        <h2>About the Brickdash</h2>
        <p>
            Brickdash is a web based game that was based of the board game Balderdash. In our version of the game
            players will attempt to answer questions that are generated. Depending on who starts the game, players will
            go around taking turns reading out the questions as other players attempt to answer the question correctly.
            To learn more check out the rules page and remember to always have fun! Thanks for choosing Brickdash!

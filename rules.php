            The goal is to get the most possible points within the number of rounds that is specified by you the players.
            After all players are in your waiting room, we can then start off with the first round! First, players will

            *** all players will vote on what they believe is the correct answer or which is the most appealing to them.
            Lastly, make memorable stories, memes and always have fun!
